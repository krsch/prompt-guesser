# Project Meta — Prompt Guesser v0.1

**Project Stage:** Prototype / Design Phase  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10  

**Scope for v0.1:**  
- Core gameplay rules fully defined.  
- Round structure, roles, and scoring established.  
- Neutral, functional terminology chosen for clarity.  
- Automatic timeouts implemented conceptually to prevent stalling.  
- Edge cases for inactivity and disconnections documented.  
- Future improvements deferred to a companion document.

**Objectives for v0.1:**  
1. Create a working prototype that supports 4–6 players.  
2. Ensure the game loop (prompt → image → decoy → guess → scoring) is functional.  
3. Test basic scoring and round progression without advanced moderation, prompt similarity checks, or optional features.  
4. Use the prototype to validate flow, timing, and core user experience.

**Notes:**  
- The design documents are split into:
  - **Core Game Design (v0.1)** — rules, round flow, scoring, and edge case handling.  
  - **Future Improvements & Optional Features** — ideas and enhancements for later iterations.  
- Version tracking ensures that any updates to rules or flow are documented clearly.
